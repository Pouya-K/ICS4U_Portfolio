			Two essential Java concepts that are utilized to accomplish abstraction in object-oriented programming are <b class="keyWords">abstract classes</b> and <b class="keyWords">interfaces</b>. The process of isolating an object's core characteristics from its implementation specifics is known as abstraction. Without having to <b class="keyWords">specify</b> every aspect of implementation for every class, we may establish a collection of behaviours that can be shared by several classes by using abstract classes and interfaces. An abstract class is a class that can be subclassed but <b class="keyWords">cannot be instantiated</b> (formed using the <b class="codeWords">new</b> keyword). It serves as a <b class="keyWords">model</b> for developing practical subclasses. Abstract classes are typically used when we want to define a common set of behaviors for a group of related classes, but we do not want to provide a complete implementation for each class. Both abstract and non-abstract methods can be found in abstract classes. Abstract methods are declared without any implementation and must be overridden by the concrete subclasses. Non-abstract methods provide a default implementation and can be inherited by the concrete subclasses. An abstract class can also have fields, constructors, and static methods. If a class which extends an abstract class <b class="keyWords">does not override</b> and implement the abstract method(s) inherited, it <b class="keyWords">must</b> also be declared as abstract. Refer to the code below to further understand abstract classes.

			Interfaces, on the other hand, are a collection of abstract methods that can be implemented by classes. An <b class="keyWords">interface</b> defines a set of behaviors that a class must implement, but it does not provide any implementation details. Interfaces are typically used when we want to define a common set of behaviors that can be shared by unrelated classes. In Java, a class can implement <b class="keyWords">multiple interfaces</b>, but can only <b class="keyWords">inherit from one class</b>, which allows us to achieve multiple inheritance. An interface can also have constant fields, but it cannot have instance fields, constructors, or non-abstract methods. Interfaces also cannot be instantiated like abstract classes, and require their implementations to define their abstract methods. Interfaces can be inherited with the <b class="codeWords">implements</b> keyword. Refer to the code below, which now make Animal an interface, not a class.

			Both abstract classes and interfaces provide a way to achieve <b class="keyWords">abstraction</b> in Java, but they have some differences. One key difference is that an abstract class can have instance fields, while an interface cannot. This means that an abstract class can provide some shared state for its subclasses, while an interface cannot. Another difference is that a class can implement multiple interfaces, but it can only inherit from one abstract class. This means that interfaces are more flexible than abstract classes when it comes to code reuse. Abstract classes and interfaces are two important concepts in Java that allow us to achieve abstraction and code reuse. Abstract classes are used when we want to define a common set of behaviors for a group of related classes, while interfaces are used when we want to define a common set of behaviors that can be shared by unrelated classes. Abstract classes and interfaces have some differences, such as the ability to have instance fields and the <b class="keyWords">flexibility</b> of multiple inheritance. By using abstract classes and interfaces in our Java programs, we can write more <b class="keyWords">flexible and reusable</b> code.

					<b class="keyWords">Answer: D.</b> We learned earlier that abstract classes are those that have at least 1 abstract method. We also learned that if a class has an abstract method, then it MUST be declared as abstract. Thereofore, the correct answer is D.

					<b class="keyWords">Answer: A.</b> In order for an abstract class to be inherited, it's abstract classes must be overridden and implemented properly.
