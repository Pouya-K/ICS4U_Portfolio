		<p class="firstPar">Programming is a skill that has been gaining a lot of popularity in recent times. It has become an essential skill in various fields, including business, engineering, and technology. My journey with programming started in grade 9, where I was introduced to the language of processing. Processing is a language that is designed to make it easy to program interactive graphics and animations. I found the language fascinating and challenging at the same time. It required a lot of patience and practice, but I was determined to learn it. I spent many hours practicing and experimenting with the language, and eventually, I was able to build some exciting projects.</p>

			During the summer after grade 9, I decided to expand my programming knowledge by learning python. I turned to youtube tutorials as a resource to help me learn python. The tutorials provided me with a solid foundation in python, and I was able to build some small projects like a calculator and a simple game. I enjoyed the process of learning python, and it gave me a lot of confidence in my programming abilities.

			For the past year, I have been learning Java, as well as HTML, Javascript, and CSS. Java is a powerful programming language that is used extensively in enterprise applications. I found Java to be challenging, but I was determined to learn it. HTML, Javascript, and CSS are the building blocks of the internet. Learning these languages was essential in understanding how web development works. I have been able to build some exciting web applications using these languages, and it has been a lot of fun. After building a solid foundation on HTML, I created a website with the help of my friend, Luka Jovanovic, designed to help grade 10 students with their math homework. The link to that website can be found <a class="linkExt" href="https://nelimalu.github.io/Apothem/" target="_blank">here.</a>

			Overall, my experience with programming has been challenging, but also rewarding. I have learned many valuable skills that have helped me in other areas of my life. Programming has taught me to be patient, persistent, and creative. I have also gained a lot of confidence in my abilities to solve problems and build exciting projects. I look forward to continuing my programming journey and learning new languages and technologies. <a class="linkExt" href="https://github.com/Pouya-K" target="_blank">Here</a> you can find the link to my Github account, which has most of the code I have written in the past year, feel free to look around! :)

			In the future, I certainly hope to continue in the field of software development, and have a few ideas on what I wish to create. Firstly, I want to work/build some sort of artificial intelligence. I am extremely fascinated by AI such as ChatGPT, and would like to create an AI or machine learning application for medical diagnosis, financial analysis, or predictive maintenance. Second, I would love to one day work with virtual or augmented reality. I love playing VR games, and hope to one day be able to work on a project with virtual reality. Thirdly, I would like to work on smart home gadgets. I love how everything nowadays can be controlled with our phones, and feel that I can one day design one of those gadgets.
